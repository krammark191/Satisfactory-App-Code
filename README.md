# Overview

This app is a very simple directory app for a game called Satisfactory. Currently there are three pages, the landing page, the maintenance page, and the ores page. The maintenance page is for creating links from one fragment to another without fully building the next fragment. The Ores page is the first real content page, it has 9 image buttons that currently go nowhere, but the plan is for them to go to another activity that displays content related to that button.

My idea behind creating this app is to learn how to create apps and how to use android studio. I learned that I end up using xml and the layout editor much more that actual coding in Kotlin.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
